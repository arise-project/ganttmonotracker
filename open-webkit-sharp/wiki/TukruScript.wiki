TukruScript is a plugin programming language created and developed by IntelloTech Ltd. (http://intellotech.x10.mx/)


= Details =

TukruScript is a new, innovative plugin language and framework for browser applications.
It has high focus on event handling, requests and inner HTML operations.

= Features =

*Full control*

You have full control over all events, methods and requests! Add and remove plugins dynamically!

*Small space usage*

A regular TukruScript plugin needs only about 5-20 KB, while a .NET library reqires about 100-2000 KB.

*Full compactibility*

The TukruScript libary requires .NET Framework 2.0, that means: The half of the world is already supporting the TukruScript wrapper,
and the other half can easily install it in a few minutes!
How does it work?

The browser has a plugin management system which can enable & disable plugins. Fortanely, the TukruScript wrapper has a feature to detect & add them to the global plugin collection (plugins are called Agents in TukruScript), because their files always end with the .tsp extension.
Then, all the user has to do is to fire a function in the event which will notify the plugins that, i.e., the document has finished loading.
The plugins sometimes send requests, i.e. source code requests. You run a function that will answer this request.
Sometimes, you must give the browser control as an object.
Otherwise, how would you know which browser's page was modified? Then, the plugin written in TukruScript modifies it, and fires an event. Its args will have the new source code & the browser you gave. So you just detect which browser it is, and change the source to the new string! It's that easy
