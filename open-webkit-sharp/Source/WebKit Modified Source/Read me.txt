Due to Apple's license I am obliged to provide the edited WebKit files. I edited Interfaces.vcproj in order to expose more types from WebKit and use them in OpenWebKitSharp.

How to incorporate the changes in my WebKit build:

1. Copy all the folders from this directory to <webkitsource>\Source\win
2. When building WebKit the WebKit.tlb will not be copied to the build folder but in <webkitsource>\Source\win\WebKit.vcproj\<configuration>


From version 3.0, more additions to the WebKit build have been implemented, including further DOM support and many methods implemented inside the Windows port. The instructions from above will incorporate the changes to your custom WebKit build.
