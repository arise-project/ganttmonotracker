Due to the fact that from Version 2.0 OpenWebKitSharp has upgraded to revision WebKit-r97534 you must
clear every webkit related file from your build directory before building. 

I suggest that you create a new folder, build OpenWebKitSharp to that folder and then use that folder
as your build location for your main project.

Please note that the working environment of OpenWebKitSharp has changed and it is not recommended that you extract the build you downloaded over
a previous build of OpenWebKitSharp because you might confront build problems and source confusion


Requirements:

Windows XP/Vista/7 32 or 64 Bit
Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0
