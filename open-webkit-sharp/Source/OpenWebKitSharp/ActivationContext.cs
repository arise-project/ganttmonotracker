// TODO:
// possible race conditions?
// either find out if we can remove the need for this stuff altogether -
// embedding the manifest into a client application seems to work but is
// not an ideal solution - or work out how to load it from a resource -
// I've tried this already by getting CreateActCtx to load this assembly,
// but it can't seem to find the manifest resource.
