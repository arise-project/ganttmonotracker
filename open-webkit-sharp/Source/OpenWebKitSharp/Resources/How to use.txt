In order to use OpenWebKitSharp in your application you should follow the following steps:


1. Go to the Core folder of the OpenWebKitSharp solution, select all the files and copy them to your build directory. Do the same for the References folder.
2. Open your project and reference OpenWebKitSharp.dll and WebKit.Interop.dll
3. Go again to your project and select Choose Items at the Visual Studio toolbox. Then locate OpenWebKitSharp.dll so that you can use the WebKitBrowser object with your application.
4. You are ready!

Alternative:

If you have Visual Studio 2010 SP1 or above you can open OpenWebKitSharp.csproj, go to the project's properties,
change the Output path in the "Build" path to the path of your executable's and build the project. All the necessary
files will be copied to your project's build path and then you must follow steps 2-4 above. The files from 2# will be 
present in the build folder of your project.
